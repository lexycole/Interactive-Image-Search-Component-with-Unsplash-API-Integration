## ‚úçÔ∏è About 
This Vue.js component, named "App", enables users to search for images using the Unsplash API. Upon mounting, it retrieves images related to the query "African" and populates the component's data. Users can input a search topic, triggering an asynchronous call to fetch images based on the provided query, username, and location. The component utilizes axios for HTTP requests and integrates with Unsplash's API using an access token. With dynamic data handling and asynchronous loading, this component offers a seamless image search experience for users within Vue.js applications.
